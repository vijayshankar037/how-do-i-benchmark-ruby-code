The simplest way to measure your Ruby code is with Benchmark

The Benchmark module is in the standard library, so you donâ€™t need to install any gems to get it. Heres the documentation from the standard library.

 The report shows the user CPU time, system CPU time, the sum of the user and system CPU times, and the elapsed real time. The unit of time is seconds.
